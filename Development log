#       Date            Description
#       2019-05-12      Spent a fair amount time troubleshooting PIP install issues, it turned out that
#                       it was a "user rights/Windows" issue and was fixed by " --user".
#                       I never did get Pytest to work out since I switched Pycharms, but I'll have to mess
#                       with that later, i'm pleased to have gotten Sphinx installed & working correctly.
#       2019-05-13      Updated readme.rst  However i wasn't all that impressed with it's look, the MD
#                       file had a better look, and while it's used here and there, overall it's not the
#                       tool i'm looking for.  Sphinx is interesting, but also, the final product is fairly
#                       basic and requires a fair amount of work.  So that being said, I'll continue to
#                       add comments as necessary (no comments for things the programmer can see by
#                       inspection).  I also installed Kivy.  it took a while, but Pycharm had an update
#                       to fix the PIP/SSL but, which was key to getting Kivy to work in PyCharm.  Another
#                       key detail is to use the Kivy python.exe on ALL Kivy projects, or nothing will work
#                       I'm excited about what the future holds.
#       2019-05-15      Today i installed pyinstaller, so i could get a distro from the scripts.  The installer
#                       didn't go with PyCharm well AT ALL, hoever i finally figured it out with the following help:
